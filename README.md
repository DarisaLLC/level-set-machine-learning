### Installation

Not on pip :( install locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:notmatthancock/level-set-machine-learning.git
cd level-set-machine-learning
pip install -e .
```

### Description of the method

In the standard level set segmentation
approach, the boundary of the approximating segmentation is given
by the zero level set of some scalar field u (also called the 
"level set function"), and the movement of zero level set of u
is prescribed to move in the normal direction with velocity Î½, which
usually takes into account underlying image information.

This prescribed movement is summarized in the following PDE [1]:

u<sub>t</sub> = v ||Du||<sub>2</sub>

In this extension of the level set method method [2], the velocity
field v is learned from data via machine learning regression methods,
rather than fixing the velocity function a priori based on expected image 
appearance (e.g., assuming object boundaries being defined by strong
image gradients).
